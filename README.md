# MA3K7-Assignment-2-BV

This repository contains 2 files of code. 

The first contains the code to have a 2 player game on an nxn grid, a bot that guarantees a win as player 0 on a 3x3 grid, which can be played against, and a bot that plays randomly to allow for stochastic simulation.

The second contains code to find the number of singular matrices that can be the result of the game played on an nxn grid for n<=5.
